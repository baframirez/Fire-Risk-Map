# Fire Risk Mapping with Google Earth Engine and Folium

This project uses Earth observation data to generate a weekly fire risk map based on indices such as the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR), and the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI). The fire risk map is visualized interactively using the Folium library.


**Key features of the project include:**
- **Data Sources**: Utilizes Google Earth Engine for satellite data.
- **Automated Analysis**: Combines multiple layers to calculate fire risk.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Generates a web-based map with Folium, allowing users to explore NBR, NDMI, and fire risk layers.

Here's an example of the interactive map:

This project demonstrates how to leverage remote sensing, geospatial analysis, and Python programming to create practical tools for environmental monitoring and decision-making.

Future implementations could incorporate additional layers, such as temperature and drought data, to enhance the accuracy and reliability of fire risk estimation.
